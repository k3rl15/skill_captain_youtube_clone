Create your next application

Concept:

Here's a step-by-step tutorial on how to create a Next.js app using Node.js 18.17 or later on macOS, Windows, or Linux. We'll use the `npx create-next-app@latest` command 
and choose default options.

Step 1: Install Node.js
Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. You can download the latest version from the official Node.js website: [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/). Your 
node version should be 18.17 or later.

Step 2: Open Terminal (or Command Prompt on Windows)
Open your terminal or command prompt. You can find it by searching for "Terminal" on macOS or Linux, or "Command Prompt" on Windows.

Step 3: Run the Create Next App Command
In the terminal, run the following command to create a new Next.js app:
npx create-next-app@latest
This command uses `npx` to execute the latest version of `create-next-app`. It will prompt you to enter the name of your new app.

Step 4: Enter App Name
Type a name for your Next.js app when prompted, and press Enter. The default name is usually taken from the current directory.
What is your project named? (my-next-app)
Feel free to change the default name to stream-video. Press Enter to proceed.

Step 5: Wait for Installation
The `create-next-app` command will take a few moments to download dependencies and set up the project. You'll see a progress indicator in the terminal. You should see the 
success message.

Step 6: Navigate to the App Directory
Once the installation is complete, navigate to your new app's directory using the `cd` command. For example:
cd my-next-app
Replace `my-next-app` with the name you provided in Step 4.

Step 7: Start the Development Server
Now, run the following command to start the Next.js development server:
npm run dev
This will start the development server, and you should see output indicating that your app is running. By default, the app will be available at http://localhost:3000.

Step 8: Open Your App in a Browser
Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to see your new Next.js app in action!
That's it! You've successfully created a new Next.js app using the default options. You can now start building and customizing your app based on your project requirements. 
You should see following image on browser, if everything is working fine.
