Create Media Player Component

Concept:

In this Day 3 tutorial, we'll build upon the existing Next.js project and incorporate the ReactPlayer library to create a simple media player component. This component
will allow us to embed and play a video in our application.
Day 3 Tutorial: Integrating ReactPlayer in Next.js
Step 1: Install ReactPlayer
Run the following command in your terminal to install the ReactPlayer library:
npm install react-player

This will add the ReactPlayer library as a dependency in your `package.json` file.
Step 2: Create a Folder for Components
Inside the `src/` folder, create a new folder called `components`.
mkdir src/components

Step 3: Create `MediaPlayer.tsx` Component
Inside the newly created `components` folder, create a file named `MediaPlayer.tsx`. Copy and paste the following code into it:
// src/components/MediaPlayer.tsx
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic';
import React from 'react';

const ReactPlayer = dynamic(() => import('react-player'), { ssr: false });

export default function MediaPlayer() {
  return (
    <ReactPlayer
      url={'https://skillcaptain-public.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/videos/database_index_without_music.mp4'}
      width="100%"
      height="100%"
      controls={false}
    />
  );
}

Step 4: Update `page.tsx` to Include `MediaPlayer`
Open the `page.tsx` file in the `src` folder and update it as follows:
// src/app/page.tsx
import MediaPlayer from '@/components/MediaPlayer';

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <main className="flex min-h-screen flex-col items-center justify-between p-24">
      <div>
        <MediaPlayer />
      </div>
    </main>
  );
}

Step 5: Run the Development Server
Save your files and run the development server:
npm run dev

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the updated page with the integrated media player component.
Recap:
- We installed the ReactPlayer library to embed and play videos in our Next.js application. - Created a `MediaPlayer` component that uses ReactPlayer to display a video. 
- Updated the `page.tsx` file to include the `MediaPlayer` component. - Ensured dynamic imports are enabled in the `tsconfig.json` file.
Now, your Next.js application should display a page with the embedded video player. Feel free to explore more features of ReactPlayer and customize the player according 
to your needs.
