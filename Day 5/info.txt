Add Suggested Videos

To Do

Concept:

We'll guide you through creating a media player with suggestions using Next.js. we'll provide explanations and code snippets to make it easy for everyone to follow along.
Day 5: Adding Suggestion Component
1. Introduction to the Suggestion Component
The Suggestion component will display a list of suggested videos using the `ReactPlayer` component. We'll create a simple array of video objects with titles and YouTube URLs.
2. Create the `Suggestion.tsx` Component
Create a new file named `Suggestion.tsx` inside the `components` folder. Add the following code:

    import React from "react";
    import dynamic from 'next/dynamic'
    
    
    const ReactPlayer = dynamic(() => import("react-player"), { ssr: false });
    
    
    const videos = [
        {
            title: "Video 1",
            url: "https://youtu.be/0na2VPn-TIw?feature=shared",
        },
        {
            title: "Video 2",
            url: "https://youtu.be/ThIvYuCFDoQ?feature=shared",
        },
    ];
    
    export default function Suggestion() {
        return (
            <div>
    <h2>Suggested Videos</h2>
        <ul>
            {videos.map((video, index) => (
                <li key={index}>
                    <h3>{video.title}</h3>
                    <div>
                                <ReactPlayer
                                    url={video.url}
                                    width="100%"
                                    height="100%"
                                    controls={true}
                                />
                    </div>
    
            </li>
        ))}
    </ul>
</div>
        );
    };
    

3. Integrate the Suggestion Component into the Page
Now, let's integrate the `Suggestion` component into your `pages/index.tsx`:
// pages/index.tsx
    "use client"

    // pages/index.js
    import React from 'react';
    import MediaPlayer from '@/components/MediaPlayer';
    import Suggestion from '@/components/Suggestion';
    import DisplayComments from '@/components/DisplayComments';
    
    export default function Home() {
      return (
        <div className="flex min-h-screen flex-col p-1">
          <header className="p-4 text-center bg-gray-800">
            <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold">Stream Video</h1>
          </header>
          <main className="grid md:grid-cols-3 grid-cols-1 gap-4 p-20 flex-grow">
              <div className="border-solid col-span-2 border-2 border-pink flex flex-grow">
                <MediaPlayer />
              </div>
              <div className="border-solid border-2 border-pink flex flex-grow">
                <Suggestion />
              </div>
              <div>
              </div>
          </main>
          <footer className="p-4 text-center bg-gray-800">
            <p className="text-sm">Â© 2024 Your Website Name</p>
          </footer>
</div>
      );
    }

4. Explanation
- In the `Suggestion.tsx` component, we use the `ReactPlayer` component from the "react-player" library to embed YouTube videos. The videos array contains objects with 
titles and YouTube URLs. - The `Suggestion` component maps through the videos array and renders a list of suggested videos with titles and embedded players. - In the 
`pages/index.tsx`, we import and use the `Suggestion` component inside the main content grid.
5. Testing
Ensure your Next.js development server is running (`npm run dev`), and then open your browser to `http://localhost:3000` to see the updated page with the Suggestion component.
Congratulations! You've successfully added a Suggestion component to your media player project. You should run your project and see the screen like the one below.
